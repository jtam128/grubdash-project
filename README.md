# GrubDash
GrubDash is a mock food delivery application. This is a project I worked on while attending Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. It is a backend-focused project. The frontend is already completed and given to students to see how the fully functioning site would look. 

During my time working on this project I was able to practice what I learned about the backend - including building middleware functions to building error handlers to creating CRUDL routes for an API. I used Node, Express, and Knex to validate the information and send back the appropriate responses.
